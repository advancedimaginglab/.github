# AI4PM — Advanced Imaging for Personalized Medicine

**AI4PM** (Advanced Imaging for Personalized Medicine) is a joint initiative between [Vita-Salute San Raffaele University](https://www.unisr.it/) and [IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital](https://www.hsr.it/), focused on translational research in **quantitative imaging**, **radiomics**, and **AI-driven diagnostic pipelines**.

This repository hosts code, tools, and resources developed by our team, which integrates cutting-edge imaging technologies with computational methods to support precision diagnostics and personalized healthcare.

## 🔬 Focus Areas

- Extraction and validation of quantitative imaging biomarkers
- Multimodal image processing (MRI, CT, Photon Counting CT)
- Radiomics for high-dimensional feature extraction and phenotype characterization
- Automated segmentation, registration, and image normalization
- Development of machine learning / deep learning models

---

## 💡 What We Do

Our work bridges **clinical radiology** and **computational science** through:

- Development of reproducible, high-throughput imaging pipelines
- Integration of advanced image analysis with clinical, laboratory, and omics data
- AI-based prediction models for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring
- Infrastructure and datasets to support prospective and retrospective studies
